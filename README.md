## Architecture Overview

The platform is built upon a microservices architecture utilizing AWS serverless components. The design ensures that each component is decoupled, scalable, and can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

### Key Components

- **IoT Devices**: Physical sensors or simulated devices that send sensor data via RESTful API calls over HTTPS. Devices implement secure communication protocols, support data encryption in transit, and handle authentication mechanisms as needed. Examples include:

  - **Microcontrollers**: Using devices like **Texas Instruments MSP432P401R** for low-power operations.
  - **Sensors**: Incorporating **Bosch BME280** for temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements.

- **AWS API Gateway**: Acts as a front door for applications to access data from IoT devices. It provides features like request validation, throttling, and API key management.

- **AWS Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute services that run code without provisioning or managing servers.

  - **Data Processor Function**: Handles input validation, data transformation, enrichment, and persistence. Ensures that incoming data conforms to the expected schema and enriches data with metadata if necessary.
  - **Alert Handler Function**: Consumes data from DynamoDB Streams or Kinesis Data Streams, evaluates sensor readings against configurable thresholds, and triggers alerts via SNS when conditions are met.

- **AWS DynamoDB**: A fast and flexible NoSQL database service for applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It stores time-series sensor data, providing high availability and durability.

- **AWS Kinesis Data Streams**: Enables real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. Facilitates decoupling between the data ingestion layer and downstream processing components.

- **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a "publish-subscribe" mechanism.

- **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Used for storing configuration files, such as threshold settings for alerts, and serves as a durable storage solution for data archiving and backups.

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides a unified view of operational health and resource utilization. Collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, sets alarms, and automatically reacts to changes in AWS resources.

- **AWS CloudFormation**: Allows for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling automation and reproducibility.
