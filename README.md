## Architecture Overview

The platform is built upon a microservices architecture utilizing AWS serverless components. The design ensures that each component is decoupled, scalable, and can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. Below is a high-level overview of the system's architecture, along with detailed insights into each component.

### Key Components

- **IoT Devices**: Physical sensors or simulated devices that send sensor data via RESTful API calls over HTTPS. Devices implement secure communication protocols, support data encryption in transit, and can handle authentication mechanisms as needed.

- **AWS API Gateway**: Serves as a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It acts as a front door for applications to access data from IoT devices.

- **AWS Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute services that run code without provisioning or managing servers. The platform utilizes multiple Lambda functions:

  - **Data Processor Function**: Responsible for input validation, data transformation, enrichment, and persistence. It ensures that incoming data conforms to the expected schema and enriches data with metadata if necessary.

  - **Alert Handler Function**: Consumes data from DynamoDB Streams or Kinesis Data Streams, evaluates sensor readings against configurable thresholds, and triggers alerts via SNS when conditions are met.

- **AWS DynamoDB**: A fast and flexible NoSQL database service for applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It stores time-series sensor data, providing high availability and durability.

- **AWS Kinesis Data Streams**: Enables real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. It facilitates decoupling between the data ingestion layer and downstream processing components.

- **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: A highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service. It allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a "publish-subscribe" mechanism.

- **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Provides secure, durable, and highly scalable object storage. It's used for storing configuration files, such as threshold settings for alerts, and serves as a durable storage solution for data archiving and backups.

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides a unified view of operational health and resource utilization. It collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, sets alarms, and automatically reacts to changes in AWS resources.

- **AWS CloudFormation**: Provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment. It allows for infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling automation and reproducibility.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Data Ingestion**: IoT Devices send data to the API Gateway endpoint using HTTPS POST requests. The use of API Gateway provides a managed front door for applications to access data and functionality from backend services.

- **Data Processing**: The API Gateway triggers the Data Processor Lambda function which processes incoming data. This function handles data validation, transformation, and enrichment.

- **Data Persistence**: Validated data is stored in DynamoDB for persistent, scalable storage. DynamoDB is optimized for high-throughput and low-latency access patterns.

- **Data Streaming**: The Data Processor function also publishes data to Kinesis Data Streams for real-time processing and potential integration with additional consumers.

- **Alerting Mechanism**: The Alert Handler Lambda function is triggered by data arriving in the Kinesis stream or via DynamoDB Streams. It loads the latest threshold configurations from S3 and evaluates incoming data. If thresholds are exceeded, it publishes alerts to an SNS topic.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: AWS CloudWatch collects logs and metrics from the Lambda functions and API Gateway, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting on system performance and errors.

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in the `config/` directory and are uploaded to the S3 Config Bucket during deployment.

- **config.json**: Contains threshold values and settings for the alert handler Lambda function.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "temperature_threshold": 30,
    "humidity_threshold": 70,
    "aqi_threshold": 100,
    "co2_threshold": 1000,
    "noise_level_threshold": 85,
    "battery_level_threshold": 20
}
```

**Updating Configurations**:

1. Modify the `config.json` file locally with the desired threshold values.
2. Upload the updated file to the S3 bucket specified by the `CONFIG_BUCKET` environment variable in the Lambda functions.

```bash
aws s3 cp config/config.json s3://your-config-bucket/config.json
```

---

## Data Schema

The platform expects data in a specific JSON format to ensure consistency and reliability. Below is the schema reflecting all the data points collected:

```json
{
    "device_id": "string",
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
    "temperature": float,
    "humidity": float,
    "air_quality_index": float,
    "light_intensity": float,
    "sound_level": float,
    "pressure": float,
    "co2_level": float,
    "uv_index": float,
    "wind_speed": float,
    "wind_direction": "string",
    "battery_level": float,
    "signal_strength": float,
    "latitude": float,
    "longitude": float,
    "orientation": "string",
    "motion_detected": boolean
}
```

**Key Points**:

- **Mandatory Fields**: `device_id`, `timestamp`, and at least one sensor reading (e.g., `temperature`, `humidity`).
- **Optional Fields**: All other fields are optional but recommended where applicable to enrich the data.
- **Data Types**:
  - **Strings**: Enclosed in quotes.
  - **Floats**: Decimal numbers without quotes.
  - **Booleans**: `true` or `false` literals.
- **Timestamp Format**: ISO 8601 format, e.g., `"2023-10-15T14:30:00Z"`.

**Data Validation**:

- The Data Processor Lambda function performs schema validation. Submitting data that doesn't conform to the schema will result in a validation error and the data will be rejected.

---

## Cleanup

To delete AWS resources and avoid ongoing charges, use the provided cleanup script.

```bash
cd scripts
./cleanup.sh
```

**Note**: Ensure you have execution permissions for `cleanup.sh` (`chmod +x cleanup.sh`). The cleanup script will:

- Delete the CloudFormation stack, which in turn deletes all associated resources.
- Remove S3 buckets and their contents created during deployment.
- Detach and delete IAM roles and policies associated with the resources.

**Warning**: This action is irreversible. Ensure you have backups of any data or configurations you wish to keep before proceeding.
